- add -trace_command command line
- add all gene anchors 
- handling of ambiguous nucleotides for correlated Dinucleotide Markov Model
- handling of ambiguous nucleotides for hypermutation models (background counting and generation)
- alignment speed up by sequence truncation
- CDR3 inference/evaluation
- primers information for alignment (ask max)
- enable use of other softwares alignments information
- reduce output to some debug outputs
- fast initilization of proba bounds
- add pygor
- fill doxygen documentation
- more bash examples
- forum? issues? (github collaboration like?)
- memory BCR?
- autocompletion
- increment Doxygen version number automatically
- gitignore doxygen stuff
- put up license files etc (GNU standards)
- better formating for doxygen documentation + better graphs?
- output to stdout (generation,counters)
- make sure all commands integers are indeed integers (e.g seed)
- check existence of installed data
- redirect err/log output
- check alignments vs model agreement in GenModel infer (otherwise map base at exception)
- make igor error message prefix variable global
- fix model_pars / marginals ambiguity
- realizations pruning before each iteration
- record inference/evaluation time, nprocs etc (can we access the actual computation time?) 
- CDR3 extraction from alignments/evaluation
- % to introduce the error rate values (how to deal with retrocompatibility issues?)
- command line event realizations add/remove
- genomic template inference
- cython interface
- github integration for better dialogue with users
- command line autocompletion
- add a DEBUG global variable to toggle debug output
- make a "latest" version release in doxygen documentation so it can be processed in bash upon making the release
- organize todo in easy/hard high,mid,low priority
